                            "Three things drew me to this role. First, <strong>the tech stack alignment</strong>—you're using Microsoft Defender, Azure security, DLP, and Fortinet NGFWs, which directly matches my experience with MDE, Sentinel, Purview DLP, and firewall administration. I can contribute immediately without a long ramp-up.<br><br>
                            
                            Second, <strong>the IT/OT convergence challenge</strong>. Securing manufacturing plants and distribution centers alongside corporate IT is exactly the kind of complexity I find interesting. OT security requires a different mindset—availability over confidentiality, passive monitoring, compensating controls when you can't patch. At Siemens, I worked in a similar hybrid environment, so I understand the nuances.<br><br>
                            
                            Third, <strong>the engineering focus</strong>. This isn't just a monitoring role—it's about designing, implementing, and automating security controls. The job description mentions DevSecOps, CI/CD pipeline security, and automation with Python/PowerShell. That's where I want to grow. I want to build security infrastructure, not just watch dashboards.<br><br>
                            
                            Plus, Coke Canada is an independent, family-owned business with a strong culture. I've read about your commitment to sustainability and community—the electric trucks, the 100% recycled plastic initiative. That alignment with values matters to me for a long-term fit."

                            "I started my cybersecurity career as a SOC Analyst at Cognizant, where I worked primarily with Splunk for alert triage and incident investigations. That role gave me a strong foundation in detection logic, attacker behavior, and end-to-end incident response.<br><br>
                            
                            I then moved into a security engineering position at Infosys, working across Trellix HX/EX/NX and Symantec DLP. I handled agent deployments, upgrades, policy tuning, and malware investigation. I also participated in evaluating next-generation EDR/XDR platforms such as CrowdStrike, Carbon Black, and Cortex XDR, and contributed to the migration from Trellix to Cortex XDR.<br><br>
                            
                            After relocating to Canada, I joined a Siemens subsidiary. I initially worked on Cortex XDR agent rollouts, VM broker deployments, and developing XSOAR automations. Later, I transitioned to a major security modernization project—a hybrid environment with on-prem Windows servers moving into Azure. I supported the migration from RSA NetWitness and ESET to a cloud-native Microsoft ecosystem. My responsibilities included converting RSA correlation rules into KQL for Sentinel, onboarding MDE across endpoints and servers, managing the coexistence phase of legacy and new tools, and building Logic Apps automation.<br><br>
                            
                            Currently, I'm working on the migration from Symantec DLP to Microsoft Purview Endpoint DLP. I joined during the pilot phase, helped with simulation-mode testing, reduced false positives, and now I'm part of the enforcement rollout—implementing block/warn actions and coordinating phased deployment with business teams. The project is nearing completion, and I'm looking for a role where I can leverage my combined experience across cloud security, detection engineering, SIEM/XDR integration, and DLP."

                    <p class="text-gray-500 text-xs mb-3">Story: MDE Agent Rollout vs Sysadmin (ESET Conflict)</p>
                    <div class="answer-box">
                        <p class="text-gray-300 text-sm leading-relaxed">
                            "During our Microsoft Defender for Endpoint rollout, I ran into significant pushback from the infrastructure team. We were migrating from ESET, and the lead sysadmin was resistant to deploying the MDE agent because he'd already seen performance issues with ESET and was concerned about running another EDR.<br><br>
                            
                            His argument was that ESET was 'good enough' and adding MDE would just create more overhead and potential conflicts. He also felt the security team was making decisions that impacted his servers without consulting infrastructure first.<br><br>
                            
                            Instead of escalating or forcing the issue, I took time to understand his actual concerns. It turned out the real worry wasn't MDE specifically—it was the historical pattern of security tools causing performance problems and him getting blamed when servers slowed down.<br><br>
                            
                            So I proposed a controlled approach: we'd start with a small pilot group of 10 non-critical servers, run both agents in coexistence mode temporarily, and I'd personally monitor CPU, memory, and disk I/O during the pilot. I also showed him the MDE resource consumption data from Microsoft's documentation—typically 2-3% CPU—and committed to documenting a clear rollback procedure if anything went wrong.<br><br>
                            
                            We ran the pilot for two weeks. The performance impact was minimal, and MDE actually caught a suspicious PowerShell execution that ESET missed. That result changed the conversation. The sysadmin became supportive, and we expanded the rollout with his team's full cooperation.<br><br>
                            
                            The lesson for me was that resistance often has an underlying reason that isn't immediately stated. By addressing the real concern—accountability and performance impact—rather than just pushing the technical decision, I turned a blocker into a partner."

                    <p class="text-gray-500 text-xs mb-3">Story: MDE Onboarding Script Issue</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-300 text-sm leading-relaxed">
                            "One disagreement I handled professionally was during our MDE rollout when Infrastructure wanted to rely solely on the golden image to deploy the MDE agent, without running the onboarding script on each server.<br><br>
                            
                            I pushed back because skipping the script meant every cloned machine would inherit the same AAD device ID, and in Defender that causes a severe issue: multiple servers appear as a single endpoint, telemetry overlaps, and DeviceProcessEvents basically collapse into one record. You lose individual visibility.<br><br>
                            
                            I demonstrated this using Sentinel queries where several 'different' servers were reporting under the same AAD ID with no actionable telemetry. After showing the gap, I worked with Infra to enforce a post-image onboarding step as mandatory—run the onboarding script per machine so each device gets a unique AAD identity.<br><br>
                            
                            Once we aligned on that process, new servers started reporting independently, telemetry stabilized, and it prevented what would have been a persistent blind spot across all future deployments. The key was presenting data, not just opinions."

                            "One example was when a senior threat analyst flagged that a detection rule I built in Sentinel had missed an event because my suppression logic was too aggressive and a key correlation condition didn't fire.<br><br>
                            
                            Instead of getting defensive, I walked through the telemetry with him, understood exactly where the correlation chain broke, and agreed that the suppression window needed refinement. I tuned the rule by tightening the matching logic, reducing the suppression duration, and validating it against historical samples.<br><br>
                            
                            After testing and redeploying, the analyst confirmed the fix and appreciated how quickly and calmly I incorporated the feedback. For me, it reinforced that good detection engineering is collaborative—feedback from experienced analysts makes the overall detection stack stronger."

                            "To align NIST or ISO with our security controls, I take the framework control list and map each requirement to an implemented security capability—whether it's a tool, policy, or process.<br><br>
                            
                            For example:<br>
                            • <strong>ISO's data leakage prevention requirement</strong> → maps to Purview DLP policies<br>
                            • <strong>NIST's anomaly detection controls</strong> → maps to Sentinel analytics and UEBA<br>
                            • <strong>Access control requirements</strong> → maps to Conditional Access and MFA in Entra ID<br>
                            • <strong>Privileged access management</strong> → maps to Azure PIM or CyberArk<br>
                            • <strong>Vulnerability management</strong> → maps to Defender TVM or Qualys<br><br>
                            
                            Where gaps exist, I document them, assign owners, and define remediation steps with timelines.

                            "The Purview Endpoint DLP migration was a fully technical, end-to-end rebuild of our legacy Symantec rule base.<br><br>
                            
                            I started by translating Symantec's rule-based logic into Purview's condition-based model using SITs (Sensitive Information Types), EDM datasets, confidence levels, and proximity logic. Once the baseline policies were recreated, I ran both tools in parallel—Symantec in enforcement and Purview in audit mode—to compare behavioral parity and identify mismatches.<br><br>
                            
                            Most of the tuning work involved adjusting SIT confidence thresholds, refining EDM match requirements, and adding path, process, and domain exceptions to eliminate noise without weakening coverage. I validated every high-risk workflow, including Salesforce exports, Finance data transfers, and Engineering file movements, to ensure they behaved identically in both systems.<br><br>
                            
                            After the logic stabilized, I ran a controlled pilot, validated audit hits, fine-tuned remaining edge cases, and then executed a phased enforcement rollout before supporting the final decommissioning of Symantec.<br><br>
                            
                            By the end, we had fully rebuilt the DLP program with cleaner logic, tighter precision, and workflow-safe enforcement. False positives dropped by about 40% compared to the legacy system because of better tuning and Purview's native integration with the Microsoft ecosystem."

                            "When I tuned false positives in Purview, I always started with root-cause analysis to understand why a policy fired—whether it was an overly strict SIT confidence level, an EDM match that was too sensitive, or a workflow pattern that wasn't part of the original rule design.<br><br>
                            
                            My tuning approaches included:<br>
                            • <strong>SIT confidence adjustments</strong> - Lowering from High to Medium+High if catching too much<br>
                            • <strong>EDM threshold refinement</strong> - Adjusting match count requirements<br>
                            • <strong>Contextual exceptions</strong> - Path-based, process-based, or domain-based exclusions<br>
                            • <strong>Proximity logic</strong> - Ensuring related data elements appear together<br><br>
                            
                            I validated every change in audit mode and replayed historical data to see how the updated logic behaved under real conditions. After confirming clean, predictable alerting, I deployed the tuned policy, documented the update, and informed the SOC so they were aware of the expected detection pattern going forward."

                            "To prevent workflow breakage during Purview DLP enforcement, I used a combined technical and business validation approach.<br><br>
                            
                            I first baseline-tested every policy in audit mode and compared Purview audit hits against Symantec's live enforcement to confirm behavioral parity. From there, I mapped all high-risk workflows—Salesforce exports, Finance data movements, Engineering file transfers—and collected real samples from the business teams so I could tune SIT confidence, refine EDM match thresholds, and add exceptions only where they didn't weaken coverage.<br><br>
                            
                            Once the logic was stable, I ran a small pilot with representative users, monitored audit-only alerts for any anomalies, and worked directly with the business to validate that their workflows behaved exactly as expected.<br><br>
                            
                            After that, I expanded enforcement gradually, documented each exception in the register, and kept SOC and stakeholders updated so visibility stayed consistent. This combination of deep technical tuning and active business alignment ensured we reached full enforcement without disrupting a single critical workflow."

                        <p class="text-gray-300 text-sm leading-relaxed">
                            "When we migrated from RSA NetWitness to Sentinel, I started by breaking down each RSA correlation rule, mapping the legacy meta keys to Sentinel's schema, and rewriting the logic in KQL with clean entity mapping and MITRE ATT&CK alignment.<br><br>
                            
                            As I translated the rules, I noticed a lot of duplication in the legacy environment, so I consolidated overlapping detections and categorized everything into three groups:<br>
                            • High-value built-in Sentinel rules (use as-is)<br>
                            • Built-ins requiring customization<br>
                            • Fully custom analytics (KQL from scratch)<br><br>
                            
                            I validated each rewritten rule using historical telemetry, tuned thresholds and suppression windows, and worked closely with the SOC to confirm the new detections behaved as expected. I also built a Sentinel workbook that monitored ingestion health, connector status, and telemetry completeness so we had a reliable view of detection readiness.<br><br>
                            
                            Between the deduplicated rule set, the improved KQL logic, and the visibility dashboards, we ended up with a cleaner, more accurate, and easier-to-maintain detection program than what existed in RSA. We actually finished about three months ahead of schedule."

                            <strong>1. Define the threat</strong> - What attack technique? Map to MITRE ATT&CK<br>
                            <strong>2. Identify required logs</strong> - Confirm data sources are ingesting properly<br>
                            <strong>3. Build behavioral KQL logic</strong> - Focus on patterns, not just signatures<br>
                            <strong>4. Add noise controls</strong> - Thresholds, time windows, entity filters, allowlists<br>
                            <strong>5. Test with hunting queries</strong> - Run against historical data<br>
                            <strong>6. Deploy in audit mode</strong> - Measure FP/TP ratio<br>
                            <strong>7. Tune based on results</strong> - Refine suppression, thresholds<br>

                            I always review the draft with the SOC to finalize expected alert patterns before enabling it in production. The goal is high fidelity—alerts that are actionable, not noise."

                    OT Security (Critical for Manufacturing)

                    <p class="text-cyan-400 font-bold mb-3">Q: What experience do you have with OT/ICS security?</p>
                    <div class="answer-box">
                        <p class="text-gray-300 text-sm leading-relaxed">
                            "At Siemens, I worked in a hybrid IT/OT environment where we had manufacturing systems alongside corporate IT infrastructure. While my primary focus was on the IT security stack, I gained exposure to OT security principles and the unique challenges involved.<br><br>
                            
                            I understand the key differences: OT prioritizes <strong>availability and safety</strong> over confidentiality. You can't just patch systems whenever you want—downtime costs millions, and some equipment runs legacy OS that vendors won't update. Active vulnerability scanning can crash PLCs, so you need passive monitoring.<br><br>
                            
                            The approach I'd take at Coke Canada is:<br>
                            • <strong>Segmentation first</strong> - Purdue model, industrial DMZ, strict zone controls<br>
                            • <strong>Passive monitoring</strong> - Network traffic analysis without active scanning<br>
                            • <strong>Compensating controls</strong> - When you can't patch, add more monitoring and isolation<br>
                            • <strong>IT/OT collaboration</strong> - Work closely with plant engineers who understand the equipment<br><br>
                            
                            I'm familiar with frameworks like IEC 62443 for industrial security and understand protocols like Modbus and EtherNet/IP at a conceptual level. I'd lean heavily on the OT team for domain expertise while bringing my IT security engineering skills to help bridge the gap."

                    <p class="text-cyan-400 font-bold mb-3">Q: How would you approach securing a manufacturing plant network?</p>
                    <div class="answer-box">

                            "My approach would follow the Purdue model for segmentation:<br><br>
                            
                            <strong>Level 5 (Enterprise)</strong> - Corporate IT, normal security controls<br>
                            <strong>Level 4 (Site Business)</strong> - Historians, reporting servers<br>
                            <strong>Level 3.5 (Industrial DMZ)</strong> - Critical boundary with strict controls<br>
                            <strong>Level 3 (Site Operations)</strong> - OT servers, engineering workstations<br>
                            <strong>Level 2 (Area Control)</strong> - HMIs, SCADA<br>
                            <strong>Level 1 (Basic Control)</strong> - PLCs, RTUs<br>
                            <strong>Level 0 (Physical)</strong> - Sensors, actuators<br><br>
                            
                            Traffic should only flow between adjacent levels. Corporate IT should never directly access PLCs. The industrial DMZ is the critical boundary—all data exchange happens through controlled jump hosts or data diodes.<br><br>
                            
                            For monitoring, I'd use passive network sensors that can identify OT protocols and detect anomalies without sending packets that might disrupt equipment. Tools like Claroty, Nozomi, or Dragos are purpose-built for this.<br><br>
                            
                            The key is collaboration—I'd work closely with plant operations to understand their constraints and build security controls that protect without impacting production."
